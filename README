Python practice
===============
This repository contains some partially implemented functions in Python, which
you can use to practice/improve your Python skills. The tasks in this repo are
focussed on conditions/loops.

Clone the repo, implement/fix the functions in the Python files in src/ and
create pull-requests to this (original) repo with those changes.

You can run the program from the top level, using
```
make
```
To run a specific function, use a number with make:
```make 2``` to run pattern2()
